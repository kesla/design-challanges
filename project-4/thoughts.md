* I tried something differently this time, laying out all blocks first. I think it's a good way to make sure things on a whole are balanced. Definitely something I think I will use when designing something myself from the ground up - start with the whole page - and only blocks, maybe some text, and then step by step work in the things I need. Great learning. Wow.
* I wonder if I think about web less and less that I work with Sketch - that I learn about Sketch more and more but as such start thinking in ways that's relevant for a Sketch file - but that might not make sense of the web. I think it's needed and I think it's good for me. I think it makes me to a better designer. Or something.
* What is my strength knowing web - and what is my weakness? That's still an unknown I need to figure out. Oh well.
