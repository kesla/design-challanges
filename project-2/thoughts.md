* Ok, here we go again. This time around - I'm going to focus on trying to learn from my earlier project - but also not forget to really learn as much as I can from craft. I'm really excited about this!
* I'm choosing UberEATS. It's a very different app, but I like the esthetics and I think that the views I've chosen are pretty good.
* It's a bit ironic that I wanted to play around with different states more in project-1 and I'm now choosing views without states (select etc) at all. Oh well, I'll work on that for project-3!
