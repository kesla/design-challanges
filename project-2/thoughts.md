* Ok, here we go again. This time around - I'm going to focus on trying to learn from my earlier project - but also not forget to really learn as much as I can from craft. I'm really excited about this!
* I'm choosing UberEATS. It's a very different app, but I like the esthetics and I think that the views I've chosen are pretty good.
* It's a bit ironic that I wanted to play around with different states more in project-1 and I'm now choosing views without states (select etc) at all. Oh well, I'll work on that for project-3!

* I've started to look at symbols. And I like it so far. Seem very simple and you can create a piece of functionality in isolation from everything else which seem to be handy.
* I spent some time w getting the status bar working, I adapted the iphone 6 version to my iphone 6 plus artboard. Very simple once I figured out that that was the best approach. I got help from Unn on how to do this at all, so that was also pretty nice. Would be convenient to have a custom preset that has this ready for you. Wonder if that's possible?

* I just thought about photoshop. And how completely different Sketch is to photoshop. It just feels weird that I spent so much time on photoshop over the years when this is around.
* I'm really annoyed about the default styling for rectangles. Why a border? Argh. Maybe I can define that somehow? Idk.
* Gradients are hard. Really hard. So easily look hard and weird.
* I added a background. Nothing special. Was fun to play around with craft and click a few times until I got an image that I felt make sense. Got confused first on how to add it but I think I've got it now.

* I have no idea how to create the UberEATS logotype. Sigh. But I really want to create it. I guess I could try and just create it myself somehow? Just doesn't feel right.
* Oh boy this feel rough, very rough. I need help here. Gotta ask Totte about this at the next session I have w him.

* Ha! I found a setting making the gradient look a lot better. Nice.
* I need a strategy to find fonts. Right now I'm just going w something that's "close enough"
* Should prob do something next time around where I know the font beforehand

* Zooming out - such a simple tool to give you new perspectives.
* Selecting the right color is _really_ difficult. But also really fun. Green is hard, I find it hard to know if it's green on the verge of yellow or a more blue green.
* I'm pretty happy w this

* I wonder what change it would have if I broke down a design in  another way - not starting with the background and then going up. I guess it would change how I redo these designs, but more importantly it might change how I do design. So maybe next time around I should do it the opposite direction - for project-3 - so I can see how it works out for me? Maybe that will make me a better designer?

* I'm so much faster now than what I was before. I'm maybe also a bit more sloppy - but hopefully I'm focusing on the right things. I'm very happy w how I created the gradient this time around.

* It's interesting how Sketch forces me to use best practices, I used the background for the white top bar first, but that made it more difficult to center things. So I then created a white rectangle. Which makes a lot of sense, since the box isn't really a background.
* I _really_ need to get better at details. Now the background thingy had it's gray default border left. That's just unacceptable.
