* I made the logo but I didn't use the right base font for it, I chose something I felt was "close enough" but in reality it really wasn't.
* I'm thinking about symbols. Maybe we (at Mic) should create our own symbols? Create identity by using our own symbols, such as search etc. Could be a small thing that could make us stand out. Could be a compliment to our own font?

* pixels feels big all of a sudden, they've most of the time when I've been working felt big. Now I kinda wish subpixels existed in  html/css.
* It's harder than it should be to just center something.

* figuring out a grid is _really_ challenging, but it's also incredibly fun. Wow.

* colors are not what they seem - especially not gray. It really depends on how they're used and how much of them that are used.

* I don't really get the follow text. I guess it's connected to the image above it? But is it the same functionality as selecting something? Also, I'm missing the state when you've actually selected something. I might need to improvise and figure something out.

* I don't really like the way they've built the text in this view. It's confusing to me with the follow buttons and it just doesn't feel very balanced.
