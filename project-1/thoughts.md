* I made the logo but I didn't use the right base font for it, I chose something I felt was "close enough" but in reality it really wasn't.
* I'm thinking about symbols. Maybe we (at Mic) should create our own symbols? Create identity by using our own symbols, such as search etc. Could be a small thing that could make us stand out. Could be a compliment to our own font?

* pixels feels big all of a sudden, they've most of the time when I've been working felt big. Now I kinda wish subpixels existed in  html/css.
* It's harder than it should be to just center something.

* figuring out a grid is _really_ challenging, but it's also incredibly fun. Wow.

* colors are not what they seem - especially not gray. It really depends on how they're used and how much of them that are used.

* I don't really get the follow text. I guess it's connected to the image above it? But is it the same functionality as selecting something? Also, I'm missing the state when you've actually selected something. I might need to improvise and figure something out.

* I don't really like the way they've built the text in this view. It's confusing to me with the follow buttons and it just doesn't feel very balanced.

* I'm really doing my best in creating a design that would be easy to implement. But I think I'm failing over and over. To some degree I know that if I implemented this I would change a few things slightly, just to be consistent.
 * It doens't feel like Sketch is helping me with this either. I'm confused around spacing around characters, for example. I also realize I implement things that looks good in one few - but that wouldn't necessarily work in another. Which is also something that I - as an engineer - always feel frustrated with.
 * I'm also using a shit ton of different font sizes - without thinking about it.
* I don't really like that rover has such a weak selected state in the tab menu, so I made that more clear. Maybe it's not needed, maybe it's ok in an app to skip that? Idk, need to discuss w Totte.

* I need to start using real images. Using a gray box has been fine for now to get me up to speed but I'm cheating a bit.
* Wow what much faster I was today compared to yesterday
* I also need to look into using symbols
* and craft
* It's super interesting how much small changes in pixels affects the whole design.
* I really like that it's so simple to align/center things. Those buttons rock so hard.
* Next time around I need to look closer at the views I'm choosing, making sure it has all states (selected etc)

* doing design - working with sketch - is much more waterfall than programming is. In programming you can change core concept - like the grid - fairly simple. In sketch is a costly and complicated process since you need to redo so much. At least that's the workflow I've established. Maybe it's my workflow that needs to be updated? I'd love to work with variables - in the same way as you do w css.
* on that note, I see now that my grid isn't what it should be... it's a little bit too slim meaning the word 'TV Shows' needs to rows with the font size I like. Oh well. Next time I'll start wider and go slimmer if needed
