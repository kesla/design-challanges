* I made the logo but I didn't use the right base font for it, I chose something I felt was "close enough" but in reality it really wasn't.
* I'm thinking about symobols. Maybe we (at Mic) should create our own symbols? Create identity by using our own symbols, such as search etc. Could be a small thing that could make us stand out. Could be a compliment to our own font?
